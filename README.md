# 🌊 Surf My Resume

🚀 **Surf My Resume** is a **gamified, interactive resume experience**, inspired by the **Microsoft Edge Surf** game. Instead of presenting a traditional resume, this project transforms it into an **engaging game** where users surf through different sections of my resume.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

## 📜 How It Works
- 🏄 The player (representing you) surfs across blocks, each showcasing a different resume section:
  - About Me
  - Education
  - Projects
  - Skills
  - Experience etc,.

- ⛔ The game continues until the surfer reaches a **dead end**, ensuring that users explore every part of my resume interactively.
